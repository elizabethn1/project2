    <h1>My Favorite Games</h1>
    <p>These are a few of my favorite board games and card games.</p>
    <section id="master_mind">
      <h2>Master Mind</h2>
      <p>Objective of the game: if you're a codemaker, you want to create a clever code so that the decoder can't guess what it is. If you're a decoder, you want to guess the codemaker's code without running out of guesses.</p>
      <p>I like to play this game because it is challenging and fun. When I am the decoder, it also requires me to be strategic with my guesses!</p>

    <section id="uno">
      <h2>UNO</h2>
      <p>Objective of the game: you want to be the first person to get rid of all of their cards.</p>
      <p>As much as I like to play games that require me to really use my brain to think through my moves very carefully, I also like to play games that are chill and have low-stakes, and UNO is one of those games.</p>

    <section id="blokus">
      <h2>Blokus</h2>
      <p>Objective of the game: you want to put all of your pieces on the board without letting other people's pieces prevent/block you from putting all of your pieces down.</p>
      <p>This is a game that requires me to be strategic with the moves that I make, which is why I like this game.</p>
